                    As a leading independent risk consulting and corporate investigation firm, 
                    we conduct workplace investigations for employers, law firms, insurance 
                    companies and non-profit organizations throughout North America. 
                    We are able to liaison with local authorities to provide evidence that can lead to successful 
                    convictions and ultimately restitution for documented losses and the cost of using 
                    outside professional services.
                <br><br>
                    In most circumstances our unique investigative methods 
                    have allowed our clients to enforce company policies without fear of reprisal and 
                    litigation. 
                    As an employer, you'll have a solid basis for taking action and defending 
                    your business against claims of inaction and unfair treatment.

                    Since 1995, our executive management team has enabled employers to reduce liability, 
                    improve morale, increase profits and produce tangible, measurable results. 
                    We complete the information gathering and fact-finding process by interviewing 
                    employee and non-employee suspects to obtain admissions and explanations for the crimes 
                    committed against the business.Our interviews have a historical 98% success rate at 
                    obtaining-voluntary admissions of wrongdoing and thus solving complex cases.
